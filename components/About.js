          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
            that connect with API‚Äôs and other backend technologies. I‚Äôm
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job \uD83D\uDE0Aüëç

            time I learn new technologies, read books, watch movies, bake or chat with friends \uD83D\uDE0Aüëç
